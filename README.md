# CNN-Modeling-Explainability-with-Gemini-API

### Deep Learning & Explainability
The session emphasized how CNNs process image data and how explainability can be enhanced using LLMs like Gemini. The importance of model interpretation for trust and debugging was a key takeaway.

### Alignment of CNN Predictions & Gemini Explanations
The CNN's predictions were explained by the Gemini API, providing insights into why the model made specific classifications. The LLM added depth to understanding by highlighting key features influencing decisions.

### Challenges & Future Improvements
Implementing CNNs required careful tuning of hyperparameters, and integrating LLMs for explainability faced API response issues. Future improvements could involve refining prompt engineering and using visualization techniques like Grad-CAM for better interpretability.
